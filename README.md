# MGMT 590 Superstore Analytics – Team DN 8

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive business intelligence analysis of the Superstore dataset using the DIVE framework (Discover, Investigate, Validate, Extend). Our goal was to uncover actionable insights across four domains: Sales & Revenue, Customer Behavior, Product Performance, and Regional Operations.

Each team member conducted an individual DIVE analysis in a specialized role, followed by team synthesis into integrated strategic recommendations and a short video presentation.

## 🧠 Key Insights

1. **Seasonal Trends and Regional Disparities**  
   Q4 sales spikes (~30% higher than Q1) create operational strain; Central and South regions lag behind in profit due to aggressive discounting.

2. **Customer Retention Challenges**  
   ~70% of customers made only one purchase. High-value customers drive revenue, but without loyalty programs, Superstore risks losing them.

3. **Profitability Misalignment**  
   Furniture drives strong sales but suffers from deep discounting and negative profit margins. Technology remains the most profitable category.
